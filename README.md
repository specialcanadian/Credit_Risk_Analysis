# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of Project/Purpose
This analysis was done to try out different machine learning algorithms to decide whether or not an individual will receive a loan. A few different methods were used.

## Analysis

- The fourth method, SMOTEENN Combo Sampling had a score of 51%
## Summary
All of the tested models had relatively low accuracy (under 70%).
